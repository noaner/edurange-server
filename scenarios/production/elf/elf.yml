Name: Elf
Description: This scenario uses an ELF binary format infection technique (written by Nick Stephens https://github.com/NickStephens/elfit) to insert malicious instructinos into several common binary commands. Students can use tools like readelf, objdump, strace, and gdb to determine how each binary is infected.

Instructions: Have the students login to the Player_Instance. All files on Player_instance in /usr/special/bin are infected with a unique infection that the students should identify.
