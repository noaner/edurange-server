    ssh Inception Instructor Guide
  %font{:size => 4}
    This guide provides a brief description of the steps necessary to pass each level
    of ssh inception.

  %h3
    Getting to Starting Line
  %font{:size => 4}
    Using the credentials provided by the instructor, players ssh to the nat
    then ssh from the nat to Starting Line.
  
  %h3
    Starting line to First Stop
  %font{:size => 4}
    Students must use a different port (ssh -p PORTNUM )
  
  %h3
    First Stop to Second Stop
  %font{:size => 4}
    Students must use nmap to find the right IP address for the  next server. They
    can find their subnet by using ifconfig.
  
  %h3
    Second Stop to Third Stop
  %font{:size => 4}
    Students must use a public key pair (shh -i IDENTITY_FILE)
  
  
  %h3
    Third Stop to Fourth Stop
  %font{:size => 4}
    Third stop has two phases. First, they need to use grep or find to search through
    the directory for the hidden credentials.
  
    Students cannot access Third Stop from Second Stop, because Third stop is
    blocking the IP of Second Stop. They must ssh to Third stop from First Stop
    or Starting Line.
  
  %h3
    Fourth Stop to Fifth Stop 
  %font{:size => 4}
    Students must find the ftp server using nmap, and then login using Anonymous  as the
    username and no password. Then they can download the credentials. 
  
  %h3
    Fifth Stop to Satan's Palace 
  %font{:size => 4}
    Students will be immediately logged out when they connect to Satan's Palace. They need
    to use single commands using ssh (ssh USER@HOST command) to find and decrypt the flag.
